# TestForRubyGarage
 Hello, this is my test-work for Ruby Garage.
	I used PHP language. 
Application 'Im PLAN' is very comfortable programm, which helps to compose personal task lists.
	It works as with JS sqripts in user`s browser, and without it. Also my programm uses RedBean, because it helps to avoid SQL-injections. 
The plugin "Drag and Drop",ajax technology and jquery library  were used. 
Thank you for watching!
